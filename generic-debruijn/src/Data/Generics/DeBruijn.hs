-- Historical note: Scrap Your Boilerplate paper: 2003. I know that this style

-- base. I don't know how long it had been there. Will investigate.

-- TODO: should `Bind` have an API similar to the `Syntax` API? It can't quite
-- share the exact same API because it is not recursive. A traversable API? It
-- could work, but it 's a bit of a pain. Due to the fact that there are several
-- Notion of traversable depending on whether it's at the kind `g -> *` or `*`,
-- and the amusing funny-fun bureaucracy of managing the kind of context that we
-- need.
--
-- Having a notion of Traversable is rather interesting though: it let's me, for
-- instance, define `Syntax` for a fixed point operator. Much in the style of
-- http://www.cubix-framework.com/ . Edward Kmett's gist, above, gives an
-- approach to be sort-generic for this sort of things, but as it stands, it's
-- rather messy, and I don't want to go in that direction.

-- probably. I can't produce an example, out of the top of my head, why, in some

-- TODO: provide a mechanism to read lists as a substitution (probably
-- `IsList`). I'd like it to be compatible with infinite lists, `Seq`'s
-- `fromList` only reads finite lists. Maybe we want to chunk the list in
-- exponentially increasing sized chunks. It should provide access to
-- `Apply`. Do I want another access? I'll see in practice, otherwise `Apply` is
-- always followed by the identity (or another `Apply` for the sake of
-- infinitude). If I don't need an access to `Apply`, then `Seq` is not the best
-- representation: I should choose `Array` instead (I only use length and lookup
-- so far; I initially picked `Seq` because it also has efficient
-- concatenation; Note, though: (efficient) composition uses drop).
--
-- TODO: Generalise away from `Int`?
--
-- TODO: better name to `Apply`/`mkApply`, it clashes with `apply`
--
-- Note: constructors do not exactly correspond to the public interface. That's
-- because this choice of constructors work better in 'comp'.

-- QUESTION: can I generalise? In general, I have an `a`, a substitution of `b`
-- and I produce a `c`, so that composition would be `Subst a -> Subst b ->
-- Subst c`. This is not an entirely idle thought either, since if I have
-- substitutions of types and of terms (say in a System-F-like language), then I
-- will want to compose both kind of substitutions in an explicit substitution
-- setting. But it does make inference wonky as I very much do not want `a` to
-- determine `b` or `b` to determine `a` (It's alright, however, for both of
-- them to jointly determine `c`): I want to apply term and type substitutions
-- to terms, and I want to apply type substitutions to both types and terms. It
-- may be because of similar reasons that Coq has a `Lift` type in addition to
-- the `Subst` type (which is essentially identical except for the `Apply` bit).
--
-- REMARK: it may help with the above to split `Substitutable` into a `Liftable`
-- class with `var` and `lift`, and a keep `subst` only in `Substitutable`. It
-- would avoid a lot of ambiguous functions, but, on the other hand, we lose the
-- default implementation of `lift` (which would become ambiguous).
--
-- MMM: I'm realising now that there is something wrong with even `Liftable`: if
-- we have several kinds of variables, we want to lift a particular kind. Maybe
-- we want to add a symbol just like in `Binds`. Probably should be a different
-- type class to avoid complicating the standard case.
