-- | The intuition behind @Strong1 h@ is that @h@ acts on monads. Indeed if
-- @f=g=m@ is a monad, then @\x -> strength1 x join :: h m (m a) -> h m a@. This
-- is a limited explanation, but I don't know much more yet.
--
-- As additional background, for the curious programmer: from a mathematical
-- point of view, 'strenght1' is a functorial strength. For regular functors, a
-- strength is a function @(f a, b) -> f (a, b)@. But for regular functor, there
-- is always such a strength: @\(fa, b) -> (, b) <$> fa@ (this strength is
-- implicitly but critically used in the definition of the do-notation).
-- However functors of endofunctors don't necessarily have a strength (in fact
-- 'Var' below doesn't have one). So we need an additional type class to record
-- that functors are strong.
--
-- Like in the infamous phrase "a monad is a monoid in the category of
-- endofunctors", the natural product of endofunctors is composition. It is not
-- hard to verify that, up to 'map1', the type of 'strength1' is equivalent to
-- @h f `Compose` g ~> h (f `Compose` g)@. We choose this formulation because it
-- avoids annotations to convert between @Compose f g a@ and @f (g a)@.
--
-- In any case, this is a natural notion from a mathematics point of view. And
-- not as /ad hoc/ as it may appear at first glance.
