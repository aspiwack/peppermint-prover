Unfix binders
=============

_when your substitutions are in a fix_

This library defines fixed points of endofunctors of the category of
endofunctors with the purpose of generalising recursion schemes for
data types with binders.

It is still in a very experimental state: for demonstration purpose only (though contributions welcome!)
